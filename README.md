# static-web-page
a optimized web page
Here’s the explanation in clear points:

The landing page is created using HTML for structure and internal CSS for styling (inside the <style> tag).

The layout has three main sections:

Header → Logo and navigation menu.

Hero section → Full-screen background image with heading, paragraph, and button.

Footer → Copyright text and social links.

Flexbox is used in the header to place the logo on the left and navigation links on the right, and also in the hero section to center content vertically and horizontally.

The background image in the hero section has a dark overlay (using linear-gradient) to keep the text readable.

A call-to-action button is styled with hover effects for interactivity.

The footer has a dark background with centered text and simple social icons.

Media queries make the page responsive: on small screens, the header stacks vertically, navigation links become vertical, and text size is reduced.

The design is simple, responsive, and clean, showing core concepts like Flexbox layout, background images, internal CSS, and responsive web design.
